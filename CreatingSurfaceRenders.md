# Surface Rendering Tutorial

It is helpful to create surface renderings since it allows us to directly visualize the segmentations in 3D. 

### Step 1
Click on your label file, then select the "Generate Surface" node. If you do not see this option, click on the arrow button on the right of your label file to find it.

### Step 2
Click on the new node, and click on "Apply" to create the surface file. Note that you can adjust the smoothing constraints prior to generating the surface.

### Step 3
Click on the surface file, then click on "Surface View" node. If you do not see this option, click on the arrow button on the right of your surface file to find it.

### Step 4
Click on the yellow surface node, and then click on "options" then "fancy alpha" to adjust the transparency settings.

### Step 5
Enjoy the view!
